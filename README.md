Hello!
This project create REST API with Django REST framework. 
I use ModelViewSet to manage CRUD.

To run scripts from (https://github.com/chinaPancake/Get-image-info/tree/main/friendlysolution/friendlysolution) you need to install external package: 

webcolors  -> https://pypi.org/project/webcolors/
Pillow -> https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/

Also You gonna need Django Rest Framework and Django to runserver
